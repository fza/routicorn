/**
 * Dispatch a sub-request based on the current request to a named route
 *
 * Almost all properties of the original request object are maintained, besides:
 * - `url`: Replaced by a generated path according to the target route.
 * - `originalUrl`: Replaced by a generated, absolute path as if the request would have come in
 * as usual.
 * - `method`: Replaced by the given verb or a dynamically chosen one, depending on the target
 * route. See 'verb' argument.
 * - Any special express properties.
 * - Low-level properties managed by http.IncomingMessage, like `headers` etc.
 *
 * If you define `params`, `query` or `body` objects in the properties hash, those will not be
 * merged with the according hashes of the original request. You will have to merge them
 * yourself, as the logic behind this is often very custom. Note that the `params` are also
 * used for path generation, so `forward()` will throw if mandatory params are not available.
 *
 * The mock request behaves almost exactly like a natural request object. Please [report]() any
 * problems you may encounter.
 *
 * The forwarding logic always tries to directly invoke the route action, which is not always
 * possible. Depending on your routing setup, sub-requests may be dispatched at the root route
 * or other segments. That is to ensure that all middleware, that would normally be called by
 * express, has seen either the original request or the sub-request. This works by comparing
 * the nearest ancestor of the current route and the target route.
 *
 * It is possible to forward a request multiple times, although this is discouraged. You really
 * shouldn't just forward your requests, but handle them as early as you can.
 *
 * Usage examples:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // Will use all props and params of the current request for the sub-request
 * req.forward('my-route', next);
 *
 * // Will only use the provided params (and props) for the sub-request.
 * req.forward('my-route', {params: {my_param: 'foo'}}, next);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {string} routeName Name of the target route
 * @param {string} [verb=dynamic] HTTP verb of the sub-request. Never necessary when the
 *   target route has only one action. When omitted and the target route can handle the same
 *   HTTP method as the original request, this one will be used. Otherwise the first method
 *   that has been defined for the target route will be selected. This is necessary to ensure
 *   that express will actually dispatch the request to the target route. When forwarding to a
 *   route with a verb-style controller that handles multiple methods, it is important to set
 *   the verb if the intention is to invoke an action for a different verb than the original
 *   request's verb or when the controller cannot handle that verb.
 * @param {object} [properties={}] Properties that replace those of the original request
 * @param {function} next Callback
